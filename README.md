# Replenishment Outcome

The goal of this data analysis is to understand the key factors driving the Replenishment outcomes of TGF. 

## Methodology
Dependent variable (outcome): absolute financial contribution from government donors, in US dollars.
Independent (predictors): absolute financial contributions from government donors to other global health organizations, macro-economic indicators of fiscal health

Hypotheses:
1. If the financial contributions from government donors to other global health organizations, such as GAVI, decline, then the financial contributions from public donors to The Global Fund (TGF) will decrease, because TGF tends to align its funding expectations with global trends in public health financing.
2. If the fiscal outlook of government donors, measured *inter lia* by rising public debt and deteriorating fiscal balances, worsens, then the financial contributions from government donors to The Global Fund (TGF) will decrease, because weaker fiscal health limits governments' ability to make discretionary international contributions.
